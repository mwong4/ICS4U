%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEMS START HERE

\begin{enumerate}

%% PROBLEM 1
\item \textbf{Determine} all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $\log_3(x-7) + \log_3(x-9) = 1$.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Solve question 1 by isolating equation to one sidem performing algebra before then factoring}

\vspace{0.2cm}
First, we should identify restrictions. We know that if the parent 
logarithm is $\log_a(b) = c$, b must be positive. Taking the two "b" values 
from the equation:

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{align*}
    x-7 &> 0 && \text{Subtract 7 from both sides}\\
    x &> 7 \\
\end{align*}

\vspace{-1.5cm}
\begin{align*}
    x-9 &> 0 && \text{Subtract 9 from both sides}\\
    x &> 9 \\
\end{align*}
\vspace{-0.7cm}

Since $x > 9 > 7$, we can say that the restriction is: ${x| x \in \mathbb{R}, x > 9}$
Now we can start solving for x. Start by breaking the equation down into a form 
that can be factored before factoring.

\addtolength{\jot}{1em}
\begin{align*}
    \log_3(x-7) + \log_3(x-9) &= 1 \\
    \log_3((x-7)(x-9)) &= 1 && \text{LOL Product } log_a(xy) = \log_a(x) + \log_a(y)\\
    3^1 &= (x-7)(x-9) && \log_a(b) = c \Longleftrightarrow a^c = b\\
    3 &= (x-7)(x-9) && \text{Simplify}\\
    3 &= x^2-16x+63 && \text{Multiply factors, expand}\\
    0 &= x^2-16x+63-3 && \text{Subtract 3 from both sides}\\
    0 &= x^2-16x+60 && \text{Simplify}\\
    0 &= (x-6)(x-10) && \text{Factor}\\
    x &= 6, 10 \\
\end{align*}

Now we know that $x=6, 10$ but from the restriction, x must be greater 
than 9. Therefore the solution $x=6$ is inadmissable.

$$\boxed{\therefore \text{The solution to } \log_3(x-7) + \log_3(x-9) = 1 \text{ is } x=10}$$

%% PROBLEM 2
\item After Judgement Day, crows rose to become the dominant species and took over the planet Earth. Initially, there were 40000 crows and with no competition for food sources, this population of crows tripled in population every 1.5 years. A "mega-murder" is a murder of crows with a population of one million.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Model} the relationship between the population of crows and time since Judgement Day.
\item \textbf{Determine} after how many years is Earth ruled by a mega-murder.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Solve question 2(a) by first identifying the key characteristics for a exponential model}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Consider the following the general formula for exponential functions, where c(t) is the number 
of crows and t is the time in days since Judgement day:

$$c(t) = \text{initial}(1+\text{growth rate})^{\frac{t}{\text{period}}}$$

Let us determine the values required to definte the relationship from the 
data provided in the question.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        Initial Population: & 40000 crows \\
        Rate of growth: & 200 \% increase per period \\
        & = +2 \\
        Period of growth & 1.5 years \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now let's put this all together into the general formula above and simplify:

\begin{center}
    \begin{align*}
        c(t) &= \text{initial}(1+\text{growth rate})^{\frac{t}{\text{period}}} \\
        c(t) &= 40000(1+2)^{\frac{t}{1.5}} && \text{Substitute values in} \\
        c(t) &= 40000(3)^{\frac{t}{1.5}} && \text{Simplify}\\
    \end{align*}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    $\therefore$ The model that describes the relationship between number of crows (c(t)) and days after Judgement day (t) is $\boxed{40000(3)^{\frac{t}{1.5}}}$
\end{center}

    \textbf{Part b is on next page}
\end{center}

\newpage

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Solve question 2(b) by solving for the value of t}

\vspace{0.2cm}
We know that c(t) represents the number of magnificient crows and t represents the 
time in days since Judgement day. If we know that the number of crows or c(t) is a murder 
orone million, we can solve for t at c(t) = 1000000:

\begin{align*}
    c(t) &= 40000(3)^{\dfrac{t}{1.5}} && \text{From (a)} \\
    1000000 &= 40000(3)^{\dfrac{t}{1.5}} && \text{Sub 1000000 as c(t)} \\
    \frac{1000000}{40000} &= (3)^{\dfrac{t}{1.5}} && \text{Divide both sides by 40000} \\
    25 &= (3)^{\dfrac{t}{1.5}} && \text{Simplify} \\
    \log(25) &= \log((3)^{\dfrac{t}{1.5}}) && \text{Apply }\log_{10} \text{ to both sides} \\
    \log(25) &= \dfrac{t}{1.5}\log(3) && \text{LOL Power rule, } \log_a(r^b) = b\log_ar \\
    \log(5^2) &= \dfrac{t}{1.5}\log(3) && 25 = 5^2 \\
    2\log(5) &= \dfrac{t}{1.5}\log(3) && \text{LOL Power rule} \\
    \dfrac{2\log(5)}{log(3)} &= \frac{t}{1.5} && \text{Divide both sides by } log(3) \\
    \dfrac{2\log(5)}{log(3)} \times 1.5 &= t && \text{Multiply both sides by 1.5} \\
    \dfrac{3\log(5)}{log(3)} &= t && \text{Simplify, multiply 2 with 1.5} \\
    \dfrac{3\log(5)}{log(3)} &\approx 4.394  \\
\end{align*}

\begin{center}
    $\therefore$ it takes $\boxed{\dfrac{3\log(5)}{log(3)}}$ or approximately $\boxed{4.39}$ days since Judgement day 
    to reach a mega-murder (one million) of crows.
\end{center}
