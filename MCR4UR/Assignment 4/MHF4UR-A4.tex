%%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEMS START HERE

\begin{enumerate}

%% PROBLEM 1
\item \textbf{Determine} all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $\log_3(x-7) + \log_3(x-9) = 1$.


%% I would recommend sandwiching your solution to every problem between the kind of structure I have provided below re: initial \vspace, the Solution: heading and the ending \vspace.

%% PROBLEM 2
\item After Judgement Day, crows rose to become the dominant species and took over the planet Earth. Initially, there were 40000 crows and with no competition for food sources, this population of crows tripled in population every 1.5 years. A "mega-murder" is a murder of crows with a population of one million.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Model} the relationship between the population of crows and time since Judgement Day.
\item \textbf{Determine} after how many years is Earth ruled by a mega-murder.
\end{enumerate}


\newpage

%% PROBLEM 3
\item \textbf{Prove} that if $a,b,c$ are the first three terms of a geometric sequence then $\log(a), \log(b), \log(c)$ are the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence.


\newpage


%% PROBLEM 4
\item Given $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R^+}$ with $a\neq1$, $b\neq1$, $c\neq1$ \textbf{prove} $$\dfrac{1}{1+\log_a(bc)} + \dfrac{1}{1+\log_b(ac)} + \dfrac{1}{1+\log_c(ab)} = 1$$.


\newpage

%% PROBLEM 5
\item \textbf{Determine} the set of real numbers $a$ for which the equation $$\log_8(x-a+1) + \log_8(x-a-1) =1$$ has \emph{exactly one} real solution for $x$.
