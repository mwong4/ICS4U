Let's apply a similar logic to the logs. If we assune that log(a), log(b) and log(c) 
form a arithmetic sequence, then a common difference, y, can be added 
to every term of the sequence in order to determine the proceeding term. From this, 
we can form an equation and prove that this really is an arithmetic sequence.

\begin{align*}
    \log(a) + y &= \log(b) && \text{Add y to first term to get the second term} \\
    y &= \log(b) - \log(a) && (4)\text{ Subtract log(a) from both sides} \\
    \log(b) + y &= \log(c) && \text{Add y to second term to get the third term} \\
    y &= \log(c) - \log(b) && (5)\text{ Subtract log(b) from both sides} \\
\end{align*}

Since both (4) and (5) are equal to the same value, y, we can 
substitute on into the other as y and combine the two equation. 
I label this (6):

$$y = \log(b) - \log(a), y = \log(c) - \log(b)$$
$$\log(b) - \log(a) = \log(c) - \log(b) \text{\space \space (6)}$$
